# 2021

Below is an overview of all exercises, their title and solution description.
Per exercise the Solution is described by language used, where default is Apex
and only some have Javascript in case it wasn't possible to bypass the Apex CPU Time Limit.
Then it was always tried with Queueables but due to DEV Org restriction of only queueing 5, 
this would also be still restricted to 300 seconds in total.
